Siamese Constitutional Neural Network for sound processing


Current Jupyter notebooks is a part of my master's capstone project, made at [QUT SAIVT Lab](https://research.qut.edu.au/saivt/).


It applies Computer Vision techniques to audio processing. I utilize Siamese Convolutional Neural Network to calculate the similarity between two input tensors. Each tensor is a Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients spectrogram (MFCC), corresponding to an audio fragment. 


The [Dihard Dataset](https://coml.lscp.ens.fr/dihard/index.html) is used for training and evaluations.

[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) with GPU runtime is my friend :-)
